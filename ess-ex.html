  <h1>Essential Commands Examples</h1>
  <h2>&emsp;Connecting to example server</h2>
  <body>&emsp;There is a dedicated aws linux server with examples to practice with.
    <br />&emsp;Below are walkthroughs of how to use all the linux commands. <br />
    <br />
    ---First in order to connect to the linux server, you have to sign in with ssh. <br />
    &emsp;Copy and paste this command in your linux machine: <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; sudo ssh user@18.219.3.118 <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; when it asks you for a password type <b>user</b> <br />
    <br />
    ---If you are signing on from a windows device you need to download putty. <br />
    &emsp;Just put in the ip and then hit open. It will prompt you for the username (user) and password (user).</body>
  <h2> &emsp;formatting notes</h2>
  &emsp;(cmd) will be used to indicate the following text is the exact command inputed into the console.<br />
  &emsp;All examples assume you are starting in the default /home/user directory (which you will be in after using ssh to sign in.<br />
    <div class="app_container">
    <div class="commandtitle"><h2> File Navigation and Management </h2> </div>
    <div class="command">  
      <strong>pwd</strong><br />
      This will tell you the full path of the directory you are currently in. <br />
      <br />
      example: <br />
      [cmd] pwd<br /> &emsp;&emsp; I listed the directory I am currently in which is the default directory after you ssh into the server. <br />
      output:<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/pwd.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>ls [-la]</strong><br />
      This will list all files including hidden files (files that start with a dot(.)) and give the permissions of each file <br />
      <br />
      example: <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls <br /> &emsp;&emsp;will list all files in the current directory (folder) unless it is hidden. <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls -la  <br /> &emsp;&emsp;will list all files in the current directory including hidden files. In addition it will also display the file permissions for each file. <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls -l <br /> &emsp;&emsp;This command performs the functions of the ls [cmd] and also lists permissions of the files (because of the -l switch) <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls -a <br /> &emsp;&emsp; This command performs the functions of the ls [cmd] and also lists all hidden files in the current directory (because of the -a switch) <br />
      output:<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/ls.png"/> <br />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>cd [directory]</strong><br />
      <br />
      First I listed the directory I am currently in which is the /home/user directory (using the pwd command). Then I move a single directory higher with [cmd] cd .. <br />
      As you can see, we are now in the /home directory which contains the user directory and is one level higher. <br />
      [cmd] cd .. <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cd1.png"/><br />
      <br />
      First I listed the directory I am currently in which is the /home/user directory. Then I moved to the root directory, the highest level directory which contains all other directories and files in linux.<br />
      I then used [cmd] pwd to list the directory I am in and confirm I am in the root directory (/). <br />
      Note: This is not the root user's directory <br />
      [cmd] cd / <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cd2.png"/><br />
      First I listed the directory I am currently in which is the root directory (/). Now I moved to the home directory of the user who entered the command. <br /> 
      Since I am currently the user "user", I will move to the /home/user directory (as confirmed with [cmd] pwd). <br />
      [cmd] cd ~ <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cd3.png"/><br />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>mkdir [name]</strong><br />
      First I used [cmd] ls -la to show all the files that currently exist. Then we use [cmd] mkdir direc to create a new directory called direc<br />
      We can see this new directory by listed all files and directories again with [cmd] ls -la. <br />
      example: <br />
      [cmd] mkdir direc <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/mkdir.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>rm [name]</strong><br />
      The file will be permanantly removed. It is not like moving a file to the trash can on Windows. <br />
      However it is possible to recover the file with forensic data recovery software. <br />
      example: <br />
      First, I listed the contents of our directory with [cmd] ls which are file.txt and file2.txt. Then I used [cmd] rm file.txt to permanatly delete file.txt from the server. Using [cmd] ls again we can see file.txt is gone.<br />
      [cmd] rm file.txt
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/rm.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>touch [name]</strong><br />
      create a empty text file<br />
      example: <br />
      Using [cmd] ls -la we list all contents that are currently in the directory. Then we use [cmd] touch file_t.txt to create an empty text file called file_t.txt. We use [cmd] ls -la once again to confirm the creation of this file. <br />
      [cmd] touch file_t.txt <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/touch.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>cp [filename] [full path of new location]</strong><br />
      Copy a file or directory to a new location. It can be in the present directory or any other directory.<br />
      example: <br />
      First we list the contents of file.txt [cmd] cat file.txt. Then we copy it to the home directory [cmd] cp file.txt /home/example/ . Now we move into the home directory [cmd] pwd and check confirm the content is the same [cmd] cat file.txt. <br />
      [cmd] cp file.txt /home/example/ <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cp.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>cat [file1] [file2] [file…]</strong><br />
      examples: <br />
      <b>display the content of a file</b>
      [cmd] cat file.txt <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cat2.png" /> 

      <b>combine the content of two or more files</b>
      I first show the contents of file.txt and file2.txt. Then I combine them together in a new file (file3.txt) and show the resulting content<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cat3.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>echo [text]</strong><br />
      redirect the specified line of text somewhere. It can be the terminal or a file.<br />
      example:  <br />
      [cmd] echo "this line will show up in terminal"   <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/echo_t.png" />
      We first open file2 to show its contents [cmd] file2.txt. Now we add our string to it [cmd] echo "this line will show up in the file">>file2.txt <br />
      [cmd] echo "this line will show up in the file" >>file2.txt <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/echo_file.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>mv [filename] [full path of new location] </strong><br />
      This command can be used to move a file/directory to another directory or rename a file/directory. <br />
      examples: <br />
      <b>We will rename a file</b><br />
      First we do [cmd] cat file2.txt to show the contents of the file. Then we do [cmd] mv file2.txt file3.txt to actually rename it. Now we use [cmd] cat file3.txt to make sure the content is not changed. <br />
      Since the content is the same, all we have done is rename file2.txt to file3.txt. <br />
      [cmd] mv file2.txt  file3.txt<br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/mv1.png" /><br />
      <b>We will move a file to another directory</b>
      First we do [cmd] cat file2.txt to show its contents. Then we do [cmd] mv file2.txt /home/example/file2.txt to move it to another directory. Now we go into that directory to confirm it is there. <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/mv2.png" />
    </div>
    
    <div class="command">
      <strong>clear</strong><br />
      clear the terminal screen<br />
      example: <br />
      We first run a few commands to fill the screen [cmd] ls [cmd] pwd [cmd] cd .. [cmd] pwd. Now we use [cmd] to empty the screen.<br />
      [cmd] clear <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/b_clear.png" />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/a_clear.png" />
    </div>      

    <div class="commandtitle"><h2> File and Directory Permissions</h2></div> 
    <div class="command">
      permissions are a line of characters that look like this: -rwx-r–r– <br />
      you can find the permissions for a file or directory using [cmd] ls -l <br />
      <strong>understanding permissions</strong><br />
      examples: <br />
      The - at the beggining of the line signals that file.txt is indeed a file. <br />
      This file has read and write permissions for the user, read permissions for the group, and read permissions for anyone else. <br />
      [cmd] ls -l file.txt <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/perms1.png" />
      <strong>chmod - change mode and permissions</strong>
      octal values are another way to represent privledges without using the letters string. <br />
      The octal values for each privledge are: <br />
      1: x (execute)<br />
      2: w (write)<br />
      4: r (read)<br />
      In order to represent a permission with multiple privledges we add the numbers. <br />
      examples: <br />
      The octal value of file.txt is 644 because the user permission has both read and write so 4+2=6. <br />
      If we wanted to change the permissions so everyone could read and write, we would use 666. After using the command we can see with [cmd] ls -l file.txt that everyone has read and write permissions. <br />
      [cmd] sudo chmod 666 file.txt <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/perms2.png" />
    </div>
