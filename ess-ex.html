  <h1>&emsp;Essential Commands Examples</h1>
  <h2>&emsp;Connecting to example server</h2>
  <body>&emsp;There is a dedicated aws linux server with examples to practice with.
    <br />&emsp;Below are walkthroughs of how to use all the linux commands. <br />
    <br />
    &emsp;First in order to connect to the linux server, you have to sign in with ssh. <br />
    <br />&emsp;copy and paste this command in your linux machine: <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; sudo ssh user@18.219.3.118 <br />
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; when it asks you for a password type user<br />
    <br />
    &emsp;If you are signing on from a windows device you need to download putty. <br />
    &emsp;Just put in the ip and then hit open. It will prompt you for the username (user) and password (user).</body>
  <h2> &emsp;formatting notes</h2>
  &emsp;(cmd) will be used to indicate the following text is the exact command inputed into the console.<br />
  &emsp;all examples assume you are starting in the default /home/user directory (which you will be in after using ssh to sign in.)
    <div class="app_container">
    <div class="commandtitle"><h2> File Navigation and Management </h2> </div>
    <div class="command">  
      <strong>pwd</strong><br />
      This will tell you the full path of the directory you are currently in. <br />
      <br />
      example: <br />
      [cmd] pwd<br /> &emsp;&emsp; I listed the directory I am currently in which is the default directory after you ssh into the server. <br />
      output:<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/pwd.png" /></div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>ls [-la]</strong><br />
      This will list all files including hidden files (files that start with a dot(.)) and give the permissions of each file <br />
      <br />
      example: <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls <br /> &emsp;&emsp;will list all files in the current directory (folder) unless it is hidden. <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls -la  <br /> &emsp;&emsp;will list all files in the current directory including hidden files. In addition it will also display the file permissions for each file. <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls -l <br /> &emsp;&emsp;this command performs the functions of the ls [cmd] and also list permissions of the files (because of the -l switch) <br />
      &emsp; [cmd] ls -a <br /> &emsp;&emsp; stuff <br />
      
      output:<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/ls.png"/> <br /></div>

    <div class="command">
      <strong>cd [directory]</strong><br />
      <br />
      move a single directory higher <br />
      [cmd] cd .. <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cd1.png"/><br />
      <br />
      Move to the root directory, the highest level directory which contains all other directories and files in linux.<br />
      Note: This is not the root user's directory <br />
      [cmd] cd / <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cd2.png"/><br />
      Move to the home directory of the user who entered the command. <br /> 
      In this case it will the user directory. <br />
      [cmd] cd ~ <br />
      output: <br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<img src="assets/pics/cd3.png"/><br />

    <div class="command">
      <strong>echo [text]</strong><br />
      redirect the specified line of text somewhere. It can be the terminal or a file.<br />
      example:  <br />
      [cmd] echo "this line will show up in terminal"   <br />
      output: <br />
      [cmd] echo "this line will show up in the file" <br />

      <strong>setting permissions</strong> 
      chmod - change mode and permissions<br />
      ugo = user, group, and others<br />
